    <h1>
    Early Education    
    </h1>
    <p>I went to St. Agnes of Bohemia Catholic Church from Pre-K to 2nd grade.   It was a nice school and it was filled with some caring teachers. One interesting thing was there was a nice teacher who was always postive, and there was a mean teacher who whore  lots of black.  It turns out they were sister and they could't be anymore opposite. After realising the school was to far away to make it on time(everytime we are late we get detention and have to pay a dollar) we went to a school that was in the neighborhood called Thomas Hoyne.  I stayed there until highschool and I loved it.</p>

<h1>Academics</h1>
<p>I'll start off with saying currently I have not been as hard working as I was at my old school or as sharp. I'll probably blame it on the lack of sleep I get. Anyway at my old school I was a straight A student and school was my number 1 priority. I also had alot less to worry about. Now I am trying to have A's ands B's and not drop below that.</p>

<h1>Accomplishments</h1>
<p>I forget alot of what I have done, few things like my friends and I picture being displayed on a bus years ago or me being Valedictorian comes to mind. But recently I have had success in Track. I am in a group called 3A. This group is for the faster people, usually for the seniors and juniors. A few sophmores and Freshman sre allowed to train with varsity, and I got choosen even with the problems I have currently. (I cannot do Track for a month though..) </p>

<p>During my 200 meter I realised that I had pains and I could not go all out. This is what lead me to the chiropractor</p>
